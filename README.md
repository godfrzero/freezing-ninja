FN is a utility-belt library. FJ makes your code readable by allowing you to structure complex operations in english. For example, to find the objects in an array with a property *awesomeProperty: true*, you just need this:

FN.objectInArray( arrayName ).containingProperty( propertyName ).withValue( propertyValue )

Since FN relies heavily on chanining methods, the entire library can be represented as a graph:
